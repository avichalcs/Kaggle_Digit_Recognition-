# Kaggle_Digit_Recognition-
## OverView
My goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.<br/>
(0 to 9)

## Dependencies
tensorflow<br/>
numpy<br/>
matplotlib<br/>
pandas

## Data Resource
Dataset consists 42000 gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits in "train.csv" and 28000 gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits in "test.csv".<br/>
The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.<br/>
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total.<br/>
This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255.
